## üßπ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run SkillCrafter locally or using Docker.

### Prerequisites
- Install Node.js and npm.
- Create a MongoDB Atlas database and get its connection URI.
- Generate Google OAuth credentials (Client ID and Secret).
- Optional: Set up Cloudinary for media storage (API key, secret, and cloud name).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilchavan2550/SkillCrafter.git
   cd SkillCrafter
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `Frontend` directory:
   ```env
   VITE_LOCALHOST=http://localhost:8000
   VITE_SERVER_URL=<your-backend-deployment-url>
   ```

   Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../Backend
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory:
   ```env
   PORT=8000
   CORS_ORIGIN=*
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
   GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloud-name>
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
   ```

   Start the backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

4. **Run Using Docker**
   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'

   services:
     backend:
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - PORT=8000
         - CORS_ORIGIN=*
         - MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-uri>
         - JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
         - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
         - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
         - GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback

     frontend:
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend
       ports:
         - "5173:5173"
       environment:
         - VITE_LOCALHOST=http://localhost:8000
         - VITE_SERVER_URL=<your-backend-deployment-url>
   ```
